# ♛ LinkedIn Queens Solver Bot

Welcome to the LinkedIn Queens Solver Bot repository!

This project showcases a bot that solves the Queens Game using advanced optimization techniques. The game solution is computed using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), a powerful method for tackling combinatorial challenges like the classic N-Queens problem. 

To run in your computer, you should run the script `mouse_info.py` and change in the `main.py` file the coordinates of your Queens box game.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ MILP-based solver for the Queens Game
- 🧠 Intelligent and efficient optimization strategy
- 🖥️ Automated gameplay through a bot interface using `Pyautogui`.
- 🎥 Demo video of the solver in action
